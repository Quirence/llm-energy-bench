# Experiment Log

This file is the append-only human index of hardware runs committed under
`experiments/runs/`. Raw artifacts and their manifest hashes remain the source
of truth. Do not rewrite earlier entries when analysis changes; append a dated
correction that references the original run ID.

Each completed entry records:

- date, contributor, host role, GPU, driver, and power limit;
- Git commit, runtime version, model tag and digest, and config/prompt hashes;
- run ID, validation outcome, valid/request counts, and energy source;
- material anomalies, exclusions, and links to the committed run directory.

Environment probes that do not execute an LLM request belong in the separate
section below and are never counted as experimental runs.

## Validated Experimental Runs

None yet. The first entry will be the RTX 3050 Laptop `pilot-v1` run after
Ollama and `llama3.2:3b-instruct-q4_K_M` are available locally.

## Environment Probes

### 2026-09-20 — RTX 3050 Laptop NVML smoke check

- Contributor: Quirence/Codex
- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Laptop GPU, 4 GiB
- Driver: 572.83
- Reported power limit: approximately 74–75 W
- Capability result: temperature, clocks, utilization, memory, instantaneous
  power, legacy power, total-energy counter, and power limit are available.
- Observation: over two idle samples the total-energy delta was about
  171–205 J for roughly 2 s, while instantaneous-power integration measured
  about 23–24 J at 11.6–11.9 W average power.
- Decision: treat the counter as physically inconsistent on this host/driver.
  The implemented per-request sanity check falls back to
  `power_instant_integration` and records the rejection reason.
- Scope: telemetry smoke validation only. Ollama was unavailable, no model was
  loaded, and no inference run was produced.
